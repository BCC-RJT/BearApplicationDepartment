# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to track architectural choices to prevent regression and ensure consistency across the codebase. Without a record of decisions, we risk repeating mistakes or losing context on why certain choices were made.

## Decision

We will use Markdown-based Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored in git.

## Consequences

Positive:
- Clear history of architectural decisions.
- Easy to review and update.
- Version controlled.

Negative:
- Requires discipline to write and maintain.
