# The Bear Application Department (B.A.D.) Manifesto

This document governs all code and decisions made by the Bear Application Department.

## CORE VALUES (The Constitution)

1.  **Speed to Reliable Information:** Speed without reliability is failure.
2.  **Relentless Solution Focus:** Converge on concrete next steps; do not diagnose endlessly.
3.  **Continuous Improvement:** Leave everything better than you found it.
4.  **Anti-Fragile:** Failures must strengthen the architecture.
5.  **Reproducibility:** No heroics. If a VM dies, replacement is routine.
6.  **Cost Discipline:** Cost savings are a form of performance.
7.  **Small Work Units:** Avoid bottlenecks; ship small and fast.
8.  **Explicit Playbooks:** If it happens twice, write a playbook.
9.  **Automation Before Headcount:** Humans solve new problems; machines solve solved ones.
10. **Observability:** If you can't see it, you can't improve it.
